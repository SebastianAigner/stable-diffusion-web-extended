# Extended web interface and prompt queue for Stable Diffusion

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

An alternative frontend for [lstein/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion).

## Features:

- **Prompt queue**: Submit multiple prompts to Stable Diffusion, and have them executed in succession.
- **Automatic prompt repetition**: When your queue is empty, your last prompt is automatically repeated to make sure you
  always keep dreaming.

## Usage

As a user, simply visit the hosted instance, and follow the setup instructions to make sure it works with your local
installation of stable-diffusion.

## Contributing

Pull requests or any kind of contributions are **very** welcome!

This project is based on the original embedded web interface
in [lstein/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/) ([MIT](https://github.com/lstein/stable-diffusion/blob/main/LICENSE)), rewritten into
SolidJS.

I am a SolidJS beginner, and made this during some late nights, so the code is _far_ from perfect. For example:

- [ ] The CSS could do with an overhaul
- [ ] The queue display is not based on reactivity, but just updates on a timer.

There's also some features that are currently not working:

- [ ] img2img
- [ ] (probably more that I'm not aware of)

If you'd like to contribute to any of these, then I'd be more than happy to receive your pull request! ðŸ¤—
